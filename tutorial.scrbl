<Bike> like in general, or a "this is what's different from asdf2" thing?

<Xach> I would like more scenario-driven examples,
e.g. "If you have a piece that has to be compiled via a separate process,
here's how the system file can help you do it."
Not ASDF3-specific, I'd like to see more things like that in general.
"If you want your FASL files for project/ to be stored in project/fasls/ rather than globally,
here's how to do it."
I suppose that's more manual than tutorial
