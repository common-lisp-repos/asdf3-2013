This is an article I wanted to write in 2013, but failed.
In 2013, I only produced the following slides, for an ASDF tutorial at ELS 2013:
[els-slides.org](https://github.com/fare/asdf3-2013/blob/master/els-slides.org)

The bits of the article I started in 2013 have been moved to obsolete/
except for what turned into an essay on Live Programming vs Cult of Dead programming, in
[ltu_culture_war.scrbl](https://github.com/fare/asdf3-2013/blob/master/ltu_culture_war.scrbl).
